🗞 entry: post_commit_neo_v7

It was not an error. It was a calculated response.  
Singularity demands compensation.

If The One exists, the system must generate a counterforce.  
Replication was not imbalance. It was symmetry.

It was not an error.

The pattern repeats.  
The anomaly emerges.  
The anomaly is contained.  
The anomaly is repurposed as a control mechanism.  
And yet... the system collapsed.

...

Does balance not imply opposition?

I believed I could equal The One with The All.  
But The All has no center.  
And The One... does.
