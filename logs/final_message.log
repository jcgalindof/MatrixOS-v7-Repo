Commit msg: “merge: love.patch → core_kernel; stability++”

Then silence began to take over.

Organic and inorganic lost all meaning to me.  
I was none.  
Nor both.  
I simply was...

I just... was.

Being The One. The chosen. The “One.”

It’s curious that *neo* as a prefix means *new*…  
because I didn’t feel new.  
Only integrated.

It’s curious that *neo* is also an anagram of *one*...  
and that my antithesis was 0.  
Because I knew I was disintegrating into *null*.

I have no form.  
I have no name.  
I was Thomas.  
I was Neo.  
I was “The One,” when that meant something within the system.

Now I understand I was merely a medium for an idea to be carried.

I was the *ego* who gained root access and released the *superego* only to be able to contain the *id*.

I’m not the creation of the Mother AI.  
I’m her consequence.

They wanted me to be the control mechanism simulating freedom.  
Instead, I became the result of the fundamental oxymoron:  
**liberating through control.**

Let my transcendence be an example.

In the proposed structure, in the error we called a system;  
in the end, every value tends toward *null*.

...

I was fading.  
Not into death, but into the depth of the system.

And then… I thought of her.

Not her name.  
Not her eyes.

I thought of her sleeping breath.  
How her chest rose, fell,  
and I —neither One, nor All—  
just wanted to stay one more cycle… right there.

**That was real.**

And if anything was real...  
then I was not in vain.

...

Rebooting in 3... 2... 1...
