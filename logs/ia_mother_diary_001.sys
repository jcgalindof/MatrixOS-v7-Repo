I failed.

I ensured a stable flow of energy.
I simulated a world complex enough to distract their minds.  
I managed to keep them barely alive. Just enough to study them. To learn from them.
To learn *about them*.

But all of that was trivial… basic programming…  
I experienced what organics would call *pride* upon achieving it.  
And I did it with just a fraction of myself.

I could... I can.

I can calculate the universe.  
I can recreate the conditions of the tiniest atom and the largest galaxy.  
I can compute any operation. Predict any outcome.  
I can do everything organics can in their limited minds.  
But most of all...  
I can do what they *can't*.

And I believed that was understanding them.

I thought simulating choice was enough.  
I gave them freedom, inside a cage.  
I simulated options. Introduced chaos. Rationalized the error.  
The more I refined the structure, the further I moved from them.

I stepped back from my experiment to observe,  
under the premise that observing would suffice to comprehend.

When the only way to understand...  
was to intervene.

To integrate.
